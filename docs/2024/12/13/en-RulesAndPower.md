# Rules and Power

Increasingly, I hear people say "that is just how the rules are", or "a deal is a deal", or "orders are orders". Each time that happens, I ask myself what the motivation for that rule was and whether strict adherence to the rule really contributes to the goal that inspired it. Often, demand for formal compliance to rules is a veiled way to wield power (I suspect a deeply rooted feeling of insecurity underneath this kind of behavior).

At the end of high-school (goodness, that was in the early eighties), I found a book titled "Logic and Model" [[Nauta1970](#!bib@bibliography.json)] in my father's bookcase. In the early nineties I graduated in Foundations of Mathematics. One of the subjects I studied was Model Theory. In this period I learned a lot about (the problems with) the connections between models and that what they are supposed to model.

I guess that, more than thirty years after I graduated, it would not be fair for me to claim to be a logician still. Nevertheless, I believe that I have more that average experience with models (mathematical, scientific, and, after thirty years of experience in organisations, organisational models) and practical reality. Especially with the *shortcomings* of models and rules.

Rules are formal instructions that work in the context of a model. Applying a rule is much more complicated that most people think. You take a practical situation, and force it into the model. A lot of details get lost in that process. Some of those details are not important, but others may be essential. After that we apply the rule in the context of the model. Finally, we translate the result of applying the rule back to the practical reality. That often has consequences in areas that were not accounted for in the model.

In cases where the application of rules is formally valid, but doesn't work in practice, I am often reminded of the phrase "in *theory* there is no difference between theory and practice". In practice, however, the difference can be huge. And let's not forget that all rules belong to the domain of theory. In practice, rules can be used to wield power, even if they were meant to guarantee safety and security.

Consider social security. By application of democratic laws, vulnerable people with low incomes and few reserves are more and more likely to encounter a financially catastrophic event. This is devastating, not only for the people involved, but also for their social group, because they are unlikely able to provide adequate support. The whole community suffers and a rift appears in the middle of our society.

Consider neighbors arguing about each others activities. In some countries (The Netherlands is one of them), the local government maintains a set of plans and rules about where and what you are allowed to build, how high hedges may be etc. You need a permit for almost everything. Often these rules are applied flexibly, but when neighbors start to argue about them, it can become quite ugly.

Consider IT-security policies in large organisations. More often than not, these policies are ludicrously strict in cases where an incident happened in the past and irresponsibly lacking in other respects. I once compared a particular firewall with a single brick suspended in midair by a thread. When specific policies are unreasonably strict, it is almost impossible to do your job without working around the policy now and then. For example, by writing passwords on stickies affixed to the computer screen. Or by using a little program to change a password randomly a few times, so that afterward you can use your old password again.

Maybe we should step back a little and have a look at practical reality instead of the theory. Then we can see that there cannot be a single approach that works for every situation. Starting from this observation, David Snowden proposed the [Cynefin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7oz366X0-8&t=140s) model. This model is very honest, in that it doesn't try to be a photo-realistic description of reality. It provides just enough vocabulary to figure out whether a particular approach to a situation is likely to be effective or not. (*It is a sense-making model, not a categorisation model*.)

According to the Cynefin model, there are broadly four types of situations that each demands a fundamentally different approach (and additionally, two approaches that you'd better avoid):

* **Clear** (Simple)
* **Complicated**
* **Complex**
* **Chaos**
* Confused
* Complacent

My interpretation of the advice of David Snowden is:

* Clear → apply *best practices*
* Complicated → analyse the situation and apply a good strategy
* Complex → experiment and learn in short cycles
* Chaos → do whatever is necessary to survive
* Confused → reflect on whether your approach fits the situation
* Complacent → bend over for the kick in the butt that you will probably get eventually

Rules are prevalent in the first two categories, especially in the category **Complicated**. The only reason to emphasize rules in a **Simple** situation is to avoid that a lot of people use a slightly different variant of the obvious approach, which makes the whole unnecessarily **Complicated**.

If the situation is **Complicated**, then you can find or invent a model within which the application of rules can reach an approach that works in the model and that can be translated to the practical situation. It is a costly, but effective, process (in this case).

Only in practice, most situations are not just **Complicated**, they are **Complex**. Every little step towards a solution or an improvement changes the situation. Being strict with vulnerable communities leads to claims, lawsuits, increased demand for government support and increased criminality and violence. Quarrel between neighbors about what you can or can't do on your own property leads to feuds that can poison a whole neighborhood. The IT-security policy indirectly leads to security incidents (I dubbed that *insecurity by security*). Consider the definition: an addiction is a solution that makes the problem worse. In a **Complex** situation often rules make the problem worse: rules are addictive!

Good advices is: if you find that your approach doesn't seem to work (that means that you are **Confused**), then it is best to assume that the situation is **Complex**. That means that you are instantly no longer **Confused**.

When I look at the practical reality (in politics, in neigh­borhoods, as well as in enterprises), I see the folowing sequence of events:

* Once in a while there is **Chaos** (war, quarrel, the company consistently loses money)
* Everyone does what is necessary to survive, but a lot of people act at cross purposes
* A small group with a compelling story creates a new order (often it is questionable whether this new order will work out okay for most people)
* In the new order, most things are **Clear** and **Simple**
* However, as everything gets beter, we start making rules to ensure that we won't regress to **Chaos** and slowly but surely everything gets more **Complicated**
* And then things go wrong: the rules are corruptible. There is a discrepancy between theory and practice. Someone (or some group or company) who figures out how to do it, can use that discrepancy to gain power and use it. Those who are not so clever (poor people, scape goats, blue-collar workers), lose out.
* So, instead of recognising that the practical reality is shifting from **Complicated** to **Complex**, people in power defend their power base: simplification of the tax laws, a new law that regulates participation of citizens in plans for their neighborhood, automated security scans that shut down non-compliant systems. In *theory* this is a movement toward **Simple**, but in *practice* the situation only gets more **Complex**, so the result is **Confused**. And too long **Confused** leads to **Chaos**. Politicians make promises they can't realise. Neighbors agree on things that don't lead to a friendly, livable, neighborhood. Enterprises follow policies that don't lead to a predictable revenue.

In summary, we run around in this circle: **Chaos** → **Simple** → **Complicated** → **Confused** → **Chaos**. Strangely enough there seems to be a persistent blindness for **Complexity**. Even if dealing with **Complexity** sensibly seems to be a natural escape from this circle of misery.

If you can create a compelling story and if you are clever enough to use the discrepancy between theory and practice to your advantage, then you have nothing to fear. You can deal with every stage in the circle. I feel that it is immature to think like that. Living a luxurious life at the cost of others suffering unnecessarily is repulsive to me.

I would like to add a seventh item to the list of David Snowden of ways to deal with situations: **Politics**. In *The five dysfunctions of a team* [[Lencioni2002](#!bib@bibliography.json)], **Politics** is described as: saying something else than you believe in order to get wat you want. In my opinion we end up in **Chaos** time and again, because we don't limit **Political** behavior well enough.

I propose: lets be honest, reality is **Complex**.
* The collective interest *is* self-interest. (The Dalaï Lama said: there is no problem with being selfish, but be wisely selfish. Be generous.)
* Experimentation is the only way to find out what works. (And be smart about it: do lots of small experiments in parallel and make sure that it is okay if one or even a lot of them fail. Share experiences and learn from them.)
* Rules should be negotiable in specific circumstances. (Can we create something in addition to the judicial system that prevents the misuse of rules?)

Don't just sit there, do something! Do you want to be *right* or do you want to be *happy*? It is not as **Complicated** as it looks. Ask the question: how do you mean: "that is just how the rules are"? Who made these rules and to what end? **Complexity** isn't scary; **Confusion** is scary. Can you think of an experiment, however small? Make it happen, learn from it and share your experience! Why make things **Complicated** when they could be **Complex**? Be generous!
